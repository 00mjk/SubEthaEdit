		<paragraph>The 
		<phrase edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">"DEVONthink Pro"</phrase>
		<phrase edition_se="no">"${software}"</phrase>menu is similar to the application
		menu in any other Mac OS X application. It contains commands for displaying the
		splash screen, opening the 
		<reference chapter="preferences">preferences window,</reference>accessing the
		"Services" menu, hiding and showing windows, and, of course, quitting the
		application.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>The "Services" submenu allows access to special commands published
		either by other Mac OS X applications such as TextEdit or Safari or by services
		extensions such as our own WordService or CalcService. Also, ${software} publishes 
		<reference chapter="menus" section="services">its own services</reference>on the
		"Services" menu.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Use the free "WordService" to extend the text editing capabilities of
		${software} with commands for reformatting paragraphs, indent blocks of text, sort
		lines or insert the current date and time. "CalcService" is a smart replacement for
		the Calculator desktop accessory and allows you to enter a calculation into any
		Cocoa application (such as ${software}) so that your Mac can calculate it for you.

				<!--
				<item name="Scanner:" edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">Imports printed documents as
				searchable PDF from your scanner. The plug-in uses the
				standard Image Capture interface of Mac OS X as a
				built-in IRIS engine for OCR (optical character
				recognition), so it works with all scanners compatible
				with Image Capture. For scanners that are not compatible
				with Image Capture, you can download and install our free
				SANE/TWAIN package.</item>

			</list>
			<paragraph name="Import Site..." edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">Opens the 
			<reference chapter="windows" section="download">"Download

			and offline viewing. Make sure the download options are set correctly,
			especially the options that define which links ${software} should follow
			(if any). All links within the site are modified so that they point to the
			downloaded images or other embedded objects. This ensures that the
			page/site can be displayed at any time.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Link To..." edition_pe="no" edition_se="no">Adds a link to
			a selected file to the database. A link is a special empty document that
			simply points to a file in your file system or to an page or file on the
			Internet. The link to the file/folder is maintained by the "Path" metadata
			field in the "Info" panel.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Import New Webcams" edition_pe="no" edition_se="no">

			database, but only as references, not in their entirety or as specified in
			the 
			<reference chapter="preferences" section="import">preferences, "Import"
			tab.</reference>Unlike when a link is created, ${software} reads the
			contents of the file and uses this for classification and other
			content-related functions. Indexed items show a little arrow after their
			name. For unknown file types, this command creates a link document. You can
			also drag files from the Finder to DEVONthink with Command and Opion
			pressed to index them.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Synchronize" id="file_sync" edition_le="no">
			<paragraph name="Synchronize">This command syncs one or more selected
			groups or documents with their corresponding folders or files in the file
			system. Sync'ing also updates imported files which have been edited
			externally, e.g., PDF files modified in Adobe Acrobat. Finally, this
			command removes database items without external representation. Use
			Synchronize to keep indexed groups and their originating folders in
			sync.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To create this link, which is maintained by the "Path" field in
			the 
			<reference chapter="windows" section="info">"Info" panel,</reference>you
			have to either freshly import/index your folder of choice, or set the
			"Path" field correctly yourself.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Select the group(s) and/or document(s) and choose "File &gt;
			Synchronize" to import all files that have been newly added to the sync'ed

				<item name="as Rich Text (RTF)">Exports the selected items as one
				large rich text file (without embedded images etc.).</item>
				<item name="as Rich Text (RTFD)">Exports the selected items as one
				large rich text file including embedded images etc. Technically,
				the result is a folder with the .rtfd name extension, which is
				treated by Mac OS X like a single file. Apple calls this a
				package.</item>
				<item name="as Text">Exports the selected items as one large plain

		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Verify, ..." id="file_verify" edition_pe="no" edition_se="no">
			<paragraph>Like any database, ${software} needs a bit of maintainance from
			time to time. All commands you'll need for this are to be found
			here.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Verify &amp; Repair">Verifies all database structures and
			repair them if necessary. Use this whenever you feel it is necessary. By
			default, ${software} automatically verifies the database structure every
			time you open a database and advises you to run this command when it finds
			significant errors.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Backup &amp; Optimize">Creates an internal backup of the
			database and then optimize the database structure. Optimizing removes
			unnecessary internal elements from the database and rebuilds the internal
			structure to optimize the performance. ${software} also creates internal
			backups on a regular basis depending on the settings in the preferences,
			Backup tab.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Restore Backup...">Restores an internal backup. Choose the
			backup you want to restore from the dialog window and click "Open". You can
			identify backups by their creation date.</paragraph>
			<note>Restoring a backup simply swaps the current database and the backup.
			The backup becomes the active database, the former database a backup.
			You'll never lose any data by using this command.</note>
			<paragraph name="Rebuild Database...">Completely rebuilds the database by
			automatically exporting all items to a temporary folder in the file system,
			creating an empty database and reimporting all items. This removes any
			structural problems. Depending on the size of your database, this can take
			from a few seconds to several hours.</paragraph>

			content of the front document.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Summarize" id="edit_summarize" edition_le="no">
			<paragraph name="Summarize">Summarizes the selected piece of text. Unlike
			Apple's summarize service, this command takes advantage of the built-in AI

		<subsection name="New, ..." id="data_new">
			<paragraph name="New">This submenu allows you to create new documents
			directly from within ${software}.</paragraph>
			<list>
				<item name="With Clipboard">Creates a new document based on the
				contents of the clipboard. Note: Some applications such as
				Microsoft Word put data in mutiple formats into the clipboard,
				${software} generally tries to select the most useful one but, in
				some cases, like with Word, sometimes grabs an image instead of

		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Label" id="data_label">
			<paragraph name="Label">This submenu allows you to mark the selected

		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Duplicate, ..." id="data_duplicate">
			<paragraph name="Duplicate">Creates a duplicate of the selected item(s).
			The name of the new item ends in "copy" and both items are shown in bold
			and blue because their contents are identical.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Replicate">Creates a replicant for the selected item(s).
			Unlike a duplicate or alias, a replicant is like a second phone book entry
			for the same person. Aliases are little files containing a link to the
			original file. When you replicate a group or document in ${software}, you
			end up with two replicants, not one alias and one original. Both items have
			the same name and are shown in red.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Merge">Creates one big document out of several selected
			ones. This works not only for text documents, but also for images, PDFs,
			sheets/records and multimedia items. All the original documents are
			embedded in the resulting rich text document, PDF files are converted to
			rich text and then merged.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Delete / Delete All Instances">Deletes the selected
			item(s). If you have selected a replicated item, "Delete All Instances"
			deletes this item and all it replicants.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Thumbnails, ..." id="data_thumbnails" edition_le="no">
			<paragraph name="Thumbnails">The commands in this submenu allow you to
			create, remove or update the thumbnails for the selected item(s).
			Naturally, these commands are only enabled for PDFs, images or QuickTime
			movies. Thumbnails help you to identify a document more easily and are used
			by ${software} internally for comparing images, e.g. for
			classifying.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Convert">Using the commands in this submenu you convert
			PDFs, sheets, HTML documents, RTF/RTFD documents, text documents, and web
			archives into plain or rich text. ${software} never replaces the original
			document with a text version, but creates a new document containing the
			extracted text. The "Convert &gt; To Rich Text" option tries to recreate
			the original layout.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Sheets" id="data_sheets" edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">
			<paragraph name="Sheets">Use this submenu to add new columns to a selected
			sheet, edit (add/move/delete/rename) columns or delete columns. To add or
			edit columns, you have to select the sheet, not its records. To delete a
			column, select the column first, then use this command to delete it. You
			can select multiple columns with the Shift and Command keys
			pressed.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Group, ..." id="data_group">
			<paragraph name="Group / Ungroup">Creates a new group containing all the
			selected items. This is similar to creating a new group and moving the
			selected items into it. "Ungroup" does exactly the opposite, it moves all
			items contained in the selected group one level up and removes the then
			empty group.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Auto Group" edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">This and the
			following "Auto Classify" are some of the intelligent functions that gave
			${software} its name. It tries to find similarities between the selected
			documents and then to group them accordingly. This is most useful when
			trying to create some sort of structure out of a few hundred documents that
			have been clipped from web sites for example.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Auto Classify" edition_le="no">"Auto Classify" analyses
			the selected documents and tries to find the groups where they would fit
			best. If a document cannot be classified with certainty, ${software} beeps
			and lists it in the log panel. If ${software} finds more than one
			appropriate group, it creates replicants in the groups the document fits
			into. This function works better the larger the database is and the more
			accurately structured your documents already are.</paragraph>
			<note>If the document you are auto-classifying has replicants, these are
			deleted and the document is only placed into the new location(s). This
			prevents that multiple replicants are created when you are e.g.
			classifiying this document again.</note>

	<section name="The Format Menu" id="format">
		<paragraph>The "Format" menu contains all the commands and options dealing with all
		aspects of text formatting. Here you'll find the standard font, alignment and ruler
		commands but also very special ${software} commands.</paragraph>
		<note>Many commands in this menu only work with rich text documents, as plain text
		documents do not allow formatting (that's why they're called "plain" text).</note>
		<subsection name="Font, ..." id="format_font">
			<paragraph name="Font">This submenu is reponsible for font control. Open
			the fonts panel with "Show Fonts", increase or decrase the font size of
			selected text with "Bigger" and "Smaller", and copy the font formatting of
			a selected piece of text or the passage of text around the insertion caret
			with "Copy Font". You can then apply the formatting to selected text using
			"Paste Font".</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Style">The commands in this submenu apply a certain style,
			such as italics, bold or underlined, to selected text. Also, they give you
			access to some high-end font control like kerning, baseline shift,
			ligatures and character shape (only applicable to Asian
			languages).</paragraph>
			<paragraph>The most interesting part here is "Styles..." which opens the
			Mac OS X styles editor. You can step through all the styles used in the
			current document and add them to your favourites. Use the pop-up menu to
			select a saved style and, if you don't need it any more, delete it. You can
			use saved styles from the ruler (see below).</paragraph>
			<note>If you think the user interface for the styles editor is crap, you're
			right. But don't blame us, it's built into Mac OS X.</note>
			<paragraph name="Alignment">Align paragraphs left, right, centered or
			justified. Here, Asian or Arabic users can also change the direction of
			writing, if necessary.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Ruler">Show the ruler, which shows the tab stops and
			contains alignment and styles buttons, copy the current ruler (line width,
			indents, tab stops) and paste it somewhere else.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>
				<reference chapter="views" section="text">Learn more about the
				ruler and the styles editor here.</reference>

		<subsection name="Highlight" id="format_highlight">
			<paragraph name="Highlight, Highlight Color">In rich text documents, use
			"Highlight" to highlight a selected piece of text as you would do with a
			coloured pen on a piece of paper. To remove highlighting, select the
			highlighted piece of text and choose "Highlighting" again. Use the
			"Highlight Color" submenu to choose your favourite highlighting
			colour.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Spacing, ..." id="format_spacing">
			<paragraph name="Spacing...">This command is only available in rich text
			documents and allows you to adjust the line spacing of selected text. You
			can adjust the line height to an exact value or define a minimum and
			maximum height, adjust inter-line spacing and define the space before and
			after a paragraph.</paragraph>
			<note>Paragraph spacings are not added to those of the preceding or
			following paragraph; instead, the maximum spacings from both paragraphs are
			used to ensure a proper layout.</note>
			<paragraph name="Link...">Makes selected text a link to a URL, e.g. to a
			web page or to an e-mail address. This is a one-step command for writing
			the link into a rich text document, selecting it, selecting "Make Link"(see
			below) and then changing the linked text to anything you want.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="List...">Creates a bullet list. Select your prefix, bullet
