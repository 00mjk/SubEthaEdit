		<paragraph>The "Classify" drawer appears when you select exactly one document in a 
		<reference chapter="windows" section="main">main window</reference>and click the
		"Classify" button below the view/edit pane. 
		<phrase edition_le="no" edition_se="no">This button is only available in
		"Horizontal Split" and "Vertical Split" views.</phrase>
		<phrase edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">This button is only available in
		"Horizontal Split", "Vertical Split" and "Three Panes" views.</phrase>The
		"Classify" drawer lists up to ten groups in which the selected document would fit
		best (to ${software}'s knowledge) including the path to the group and a graphical
		score of how sure ${software} is about its decision. The tooltip for any entry in
		the list shows the full title and location for it.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>To move the document to one of the suggested groups, select the group
		and click "Move To". For your convenience, ${software} preselects the best fitting
		group if it is sure enough. Double-click a group in the drawer to open it in a
		separate window and drag it into the hierarchy list to move it. Use the Shift and
		Command keys to select more than one target; this generates replicants.</paragraph>
		<note>If the document you are moving has replicants, these are deleted and the
		document is only placed into the new location(s). This prevents that multiple
		replicants are created when you are e.g. classifiying this document again.</note>

		corner.</paragraph>

		<paragraph>The "See Also/Topcis" drawer lists documents that are either similar to
