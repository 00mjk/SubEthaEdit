	<paragraph>${software} communicates with you through a number of windows for displaying and
	manipulating groups and documents, finding information, editing metadata, analyzing text or
	changing the properties of your database.</paragraph>
	<section name="Main Window" id="main">
		<image src="devonthinkpro/window_main.jpg" align="left" scaling="40%"
		edition_le="no" edition_pe="no" />
		<paragraph>Most of your time with ${software} you'll spend in a main window. Like
		Finder windows, main windows give you access to your groups and documents, but also
		allow you to view and edit documents. Open a new main window with 
		<reference chapter="menus" section="file">"File &gt; New Window".</reference>Also,
		${software} opens a new window when you open a database when you check "Open New
		Window" on the 
		<reference chapter="preferences" section="general">"General" tab of the
		preferences.</reference></paragraph>
		<subsection name="Views" id="main_views">
			<paragraph>Different views present your information in exactly the way you
			need:</paragraph>
			<list>
				<item name="List" edition_le="no">Displays groups and documents as
				a list, groups can be expanded/collapsed by clicking the grey
				triangle in front of their name. Double-clicking items opens them
				in separate windows.</item>
				<item name="Icons" edition_le="no">Displays groups and documents as
				icons. Double-clicking items opens them in separate windows. For
				images ${software} displays a live thumbnail. Adjust the size of
				the icons using the slider at the upper right corner of the window,
				just below the toolbar. Use 
				<reference chapter="menus" section="view">"View &gt; Show/Hide
				Details"</reference>to switch between icons only and icons with
				details in a list.</item>
				<item name="Columns" edition_le="no">Displays groups and documents
				in columns, similar to the columns view of the Mac OS X Finder.
				Selecting a document shows more information about it, selecting a
				group shows the items it contains in a new column to the right of
				it.</item>
				<item name="Vertical Split">Splits the window into a hierarchy list
				to the left and a view/edit pane to the right. The hierarchy lists
				all groups and documents of the database and can contain one or
				more columns. By default, it shows only item names. Expand/collapse
				groups by clicking the grey triangle.</item>
				<item name="Horizontal Split">Similar to the Vertical Split View,
				but splits the window horizontally instead of vertically.</item>
				<item name="Three Panes" edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">Resembles
				the way Apple Mail displays folders, items and contents. The left
				hand side pane displays all groups, the top right pane displays the
				documents contained in the selected group and the view/edit pane to
				the lower right shows the contents of the selected document and
				allows you to edit it if possible.</item>
			</list>
			<paragraph>To adjust the size of the different panes, move the mouse to the
			divider between two panes until it changes into a line with two arrows.
			Click and drag to adjust the size of the panes.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Items" id="main_items">
			<paragraph>${software} displays groups and documents much as the Finder
			does. Select items with a single click, drag them with the mouse from one
			group to another, to the Finder or any other application or drag folders
			and files from the Finder to ${software}. You can also drag clippings
			(texts, images) from any application to ${software} and vice
			versa.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Hold the Command and Option keys pressed to link to the dragged
			item(s) instead of importing them to the database.</paragraph>
			<note>Due to limitations in the Mac OS X drag-and-drop system you cannot
			drag groups to the Finder or other applications on Mac OS X 10.3.9. Use 
			<reference chapter="menus" section="file">"File &gt;
			Export"</reference>instead. On Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, you can drag groups
			also to the Finder to export them.</note>
			<paragraph>To view or edit the contents of a document or group, do the
			following:</paragraph>
			<list>
				<item name="List/Icons/Columns View" edition_le="no">Double-click
				the group or document to open it in a separate window. Hold the
				Command key pressed to close the originating window at the same
				time (hoisting). This also works in the other views.</item>
				<item name="Vertical/Horizontal Split">Select the group or
				document. The view/edit pane shows the contents of the group or
				document. Click the triange in front of a group to expand it, then
				select a document to view or edit it.</item>
				<item name="Three Panes View" edition_le="no" edition_pe="no">
				Select a group or subgroup, then select the document you want to

		<paragraph>The "Search" window allows you to search your database in almost every

		adjusting your search terms.</paragraph>
		<subsection name="Search Term" id="search_term">
			<paragraph>In the top part of the "Search" window you'll find the search
			term field as well as the "Spelling" and "Context" buttons. To enter a
			search term and run the query with the default options, simply type your
			search words into the search term field and click the magnifier button to
			the right of it. Like in many other Mac applications, the pop-up menu
			behind the magnifier icon at the left hand side of the search term field
			gives you access to the last 25 search terms.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>To broaden or adjust your search words, enter a word and click
			either "Spelling" or "Context" to show a list of all words in the database
			that are similar to the entered word either by spelling or by context.
			Choose one or more words (use Shift or Command to select multiple words
			from the list) to use them as search words. The word you've entered will be
			shown on the top of the list, so you won't lose it for your search
			run.</paragraph>
		</subsection>
		<subsection name="Search Options" id="search_options">
			<paragraph>The left hand part of the "Search" window gives you more control
			over the way ${software} searches the database. Adjust them to your

			<paragraph name="Search for">Choose what exactly you're looking for or
			select "All" to search all parts of a document:</paragraph>

				<item>All</item>
				<item>Content</item>
				<item>Name</item>

				<item>Comment</item>
			</list>
			<paragraph name="Operator">Use these four options to either find documents
			containing all entered search words ("All Words") or to find only documents
			containing all entered words in exactly this very sequence ("Phrase"). "Any
			Word" finds documents containing any of the given words, "Wildcards" lets
			you use the wildcards "*" and "?" (currently only in document names, not in
			document contents). "Phrase" also finds partial words.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Comparison">Choose whether you want to find words exactly,
			i.e. exactly spelled as entered, or case-insensitive ("Ignore case").
			Choose "Fuzzy" (only available with the "All Words" and "Any Words"
			operators, see above) to find also words with a similar or wrong spelling,
			e.g. "Kennedy" and "Kenedy".</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="State">Limit the results based on their state
			(checked/unchecked). Choose "Any" to find results regardless of their
			state.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Locking">Limit the results based on whether they are
			locked or not (on/off). Choose "Any" to find results regardless of their
			locking flag.</paragraph>
			<paragraph name="Label">Limit the results based on their label. Choose
			"Any" to find results regardless of their label.</paragraph>
			<note>To search for all documents with a given state, locking state, or
			label, simply leave the query field empty and use the above options to
			define what you are looking for.</note>
			<paragraph name="Search in">Limit the scope of the search run to any group
			in the database including its subgroups. Choose "Database" to search the
			complete database.</paragraph>

			<paragraph>After a successful search run, ${software} lists all found

			any way you want by clicking the column titles, click them again to reverse
			the sorting order. Point with the mouse to a result for a short moment, the
			appearing tooltip will show you the full title and location.</paragraph>
			<paragraph>Below the list of found documents, ${software} gives you a
			preview of the documents you select in the list. If you cannot see the
