	<paragraph>All commercial DEVONtechnologies applications are based on a proprietary AI
	technology, with rock-solid database foundation that allow them to manage large numbers of
	documents or knowledge bits while analyzing them almost instantly at the same
	time.</paragraph>
	<section name="General Concept" id="concept">
		<paragraph>DEVONtechnology, on which all DEVONtechnologies' applications are built,
		is a new technology at the very beginning of its development. DEVONtechnologies
		constantly improves the technology and enhances it for more functionality,
		efficiency, robustness and flexibility.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Development of the DEVONtechnology is a battle on two main forefronts of
		information processing technology. DEVONtechnologies is working hard on unifying
		both the top-down and the bottom-up AI concepts by imitating high-level functions
		and simulating the basic functionality of natural systems. This leads to highly
		functional, fast and efficient AI systems that can be used in a great variety of
		information processing contexts, such as pattern recognition, signal processing and
		information storage and retrieval.</paragraph>
	</section>
	<section name="Features" id="features">
		<paragraph>The DEVONtechnology is a rock-solid foundation suitable for a variety of
		completely independent applications. Therefore it is ideal for the rapid
		development of a huge range of new database-, signal-processing- and
		language-analysis-driven applications. The ability to deal with any kind of digital
		data makes it extremely flexible.</paragraph>

		align="center" scaling="8cm" />
		<paragraph>The size of DEVONtechnology-based databases grows logarithmically and
		indexing is completely unnecessary. The break-even point in the picture above,
		where the DEVONthink line crosses the others, depends mainly on the type of the
		stored data. For example, it will be reached much earlier when storing HTML or RTF,
		compared to plain text or even pictures.</paragraph>
		<image name="Diagram UTF" src_html="diagram_utf.jpg" src="diagram_utf.jpg"
		align="center" scaling="8cm" />
		<paragraph>Also, applications based on the DEVONtechnology improve themselves
		continuously (the more data they handle, the better the results), are
		language-independent and iron out any irregularities by applying fuzzy
		logic.</paragraph>
	</section>
	<section name="Structure" id="structure">
		<paragraph>The DEVONtechnology consists of a kernel and several layers. Together
		they perform all the underlying computing, from "simple" data handling to complex
		signal processing.</paragraph>
		<paragraph name="Kernel">The kernel is the foundation for all layers and
		applications and is responsible for data handling, semantic and associative data
		processing, signal processing, fast statistic analyses and all fuzzy algorithms. It
		has to be as fast, flexible, and extensible as possible; it is 64-bit aware and
		uses a generic, proprietary file format (see above) allowing it to verify and
		repair low level data consistency, featuring logarithmic growth of the database and
		logarithmic speed decrease with increasing database size. The DEVONtechnology
		kernel is Unicode-aware, completely language-independent and self-optimizing and
		self-organizing.</paragraph>
		<paragraph name="Layers">The layers form a shell around the kernel and provide
		high-level functions for the applications built on top of them. The database layer,
		for example, is used to store and organize data and supports all kinds of relations
		(1:n, n:1, n:n), hierarchies and freeform databases. No indexing or primary keys
		are required, strings can be unlimited in size and it's possible at any time to
		extend the range of pre-defined data types (Boolean, character, float, double,
		signed, unsigned, string, date, time, blob, color, size, and point). Another layer,
		the XML layer, makes it easy to handle XML code within the DEVONtechnology; it has
		a very small overhead, compared to DOM parsers or available XML databases, requires
		no indexing and supports the tight integration of other databases (and vice
		versa).</paragraph>
	</section>
	<section name="Applications" id="applications">
		<paragraph>Some of the most likely applications for the DEVONtechnology are
		databases (knowledge bases, expert systems, search engines,
		table-of-content-generators, instant data-mining), intelligent agents, encryption,
		compression and archiving. Other uses for DEVONtechnology may be chat-bots,
		context-sensitive help, optical character recognition (OCR), speech analysis,
		recognition and synthesis, staticstics, thesauri and automatic
		translations.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>In particular, applications dependant on processing human language,
		either written or spoken, benefit from the flexible technology foundation. So,
		DEVONtechnologies' main focus in the development of new applications is in these
		areas: databases, "intelligent" agents, text and speech analysis,
		statistics.</paragraph>
		<paragraph>Look forward to see a great range of different applications based on the
		DEVONtechnology. A few have already been announced on the DEVONtechnologies web
		site:
