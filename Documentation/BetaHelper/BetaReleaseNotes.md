###Command Line Tool : see 2.0 (6425) Installer
for Download from **Dropbox**: [SEEÂ CommandLineTool-2.0_6425.pkg](https://www.dropbox.com/s/bo0otripo9l74yn/SEE%C2%A0CommandLineTool-2.0_6425.pkg)



The Installer places the see binary in:

    /usr/bin/ 
    
It is possible that per former instruction there is a version of `see` in `/usr/local/bin` - should weird stuff happen check your version with `see -v` and/or the location of the script with `which see` and should your version be the wrong one or in the wrong place delete it and install it via the installer - otherwise: Report a bug.

### "Authenticated Save" Script

for Download from **Dropbox**: [SubEthaEdit_AuthenticatedSave.scpt](https://www.dropbox.com/s/184w7ra2auk0y9o/SubEthaEdit_AuthenticatedSave.scpt)


the **TCM Dropbox** *Shared App Resources/SubEthaEdit-SEE* folder.

Trying to save a file where authentication is needed will prompt you to download the authenticated save script `SubEthaEdit_AuthenticatedSave.scpt` from  
[http://www.subethaedit.net/authenticationhelper (en)](http://www.subethaedit.net/authenticationhelper)  
[http://subethaedit.net/authentifizierungshelfer (de)](http://subethaedit.net/authentifizierungshelfer)  
 - the website there does not exist quite yet but it also opens the folder where the script should go:



    ~/Library/Application Scripts/de.codingmonkeys.SubEthaEdit.MacBETA/
    
After puting the script there, saving will promt you to enter your password for *osascript*.
